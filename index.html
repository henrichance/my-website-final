		<p>A «vintage» watch, unlike modern watches, has not been in production for a long time and is often over 40 years old. We like them for their particular aesthetic codes, their patinas and all the traces that remind us of a time when the watch as a tool was essential. Vintage watches can also include Diving watches, Sport watches such as chronographs, or Fine Watchmaking watches, whether automatic watches or quartz watches. Our wish is simple: Focus on certain vintage pieces, give you sales or investment advice, purchase and collection, which may lead us to present you with watch selections. Without forgetting our main motivation: watchmaking is a world where you can enjoy yourself without necessarily spending large amounts, so we will also talk about affordable old watches</p>
